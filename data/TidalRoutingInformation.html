    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Tidal Routing Plugin is designed to compute DR and ETA
      positions along a previously planned outline route. The ETA
      calculation uses tidal current GRIB files, in conjunction with the
      Grib Plugin.</p>
    <h3>Quick Start</h3>
    <p>You will need to start by creating a route. When the
      calculation of the tidal route starts you will be asked for the
      name of this route.</p>
    <p>For ETA calculations, load the GRIB file containing tidal current
      data using the grib plugin. Next, open the Tidal Routing plugin from
      the main toolbar. </p>
    <p>For DR calculations the plugin will ignore the Grib plugin and any
      grib data.</p>
    <p>Enter the name for the route When ready, select "Calculate
      DR" or “Calculate ETA” from the plugin dialogue to
      compute the route. </p>
    <p>If you decide to “Save as GPX File” this will make a
      file that can then be imported into OpenCPN. The advantage of this
      will be that the route shown on the chart will have named waypoints.
      Those made within the plugin are not named.</p>
    <h3>Failures</h3>
    <p>If the ETA route fails to compute this could be due to the GRIB
      file not covering the time period for undertaking the planned route.</p>
    <p>The GRIB file must cover the whole area of the planned route.</p>
    <p>By inspecting the GRIB coverage of the route, there may be legs of
      the route which do not lie within 4 grib points. In this case the
      calculation will fail because the tidal current set/rate cannot be
      estimated. The outline route can be adjusted so that it falls within
      the grib coverage and then saved as a new GPX file. This problem is
      most common near the coastline.</p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>No account is taken of the ability to sail this route. Constant
      speeds in still water are assumed.</p>
    <p>Further work will be needed in areas where tidal current gribs are
      not available.</p>
    <p>All bearings/courses are in Degrees True. For ETA calculations the
      times used from the GRIB will be in the same timezone as the GRIB,
      often UTC.</p>
    <h3>GRIB resources</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.sailingweatheronline.com/">http://www.sailingweatheronline.com</a>
      is a good source for downloading tidal current gribs.</p>

      maintained by Mike Rossiter. Sean Depagnier's work on the Weather
      Routing plugin formed the template for this plugin. </h4>
